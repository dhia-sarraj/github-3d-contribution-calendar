# Color-Coded 3D Github Contribution Graphs

![3D Calendar](https://github-3d-contribution-calendar.vercel.app/api?username=swolchok)

## Overview
A friendly little project that renders a **3D-style Github contribution calendar** as an animated image.
Each type of contribution (commits, issues, PRs, etc.) gets its own color so you can quickly see the shape of someone's activity - now with more depth and fun!

## Features
- Renders a vibrant, 3D-style calendar showing your GitHub contributions.
- Easy to embed anywhere (README, blog, portfolio).
- Small and fast: served as a single image URL, no client-side JS needed.

## Quick Demo
Copy and paste this into your markdown, and that's it. Simple!

Change the `?username=` value to your Github username.

```md

```

**Note:** If you're not sure how to add a README to your Github profile, here's the full [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/how-tos/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/managing-your-profile-readme) to guide you through the process.

## Color Themes
With inbuilt themes, you can customize the look of your calendar.

Use `&colorTheme=THEME_NAME` parameter like so:

> Options: `&colorTheme=dark,light`

```md
![Dhia's Github Calendar](https://github-3d-contribution-calendar.vercel.app/api?username=dhia-sarraj&colorTheme=light)
```

## Contributing
Contributions and ideas are welcome! If you want to:
* Add new color themes
* Improve rendering performance
* etc.

Feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request! Clear and concise changes help us review and merge them more efficiently.

**⚠️ Note:** The calendar image might take a moment to load, especially if there's a lot of data or a slow internet connection. If you have any ideas on how to speed it up, we'd love to hear them!
